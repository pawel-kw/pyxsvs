Required packages
-----------------

 * [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) - for plotting and calculations.
 * [fabio](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fable/wiki/fabio) - for reading detector 
    data files in different formats.
 * [lmfit](http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/lmfit/) - flexible and easy 
    to use non-linear least square fitting utilities. Not really used at the moment...
